# 🧬 SPR{K}3 BRAIDED SCAN ARCHITECTURE v1.0

## Executive Summary
SPR{K}3 Braided Scan detects supply chain vulnerabilities across ML ecosystems.
Scans multiple related repositories simultaneously and correlates findings.

## System Architecture
- Multi-Engine Orchestration (parallel repository scanning)
- Bio-Intelligence (pattern detection across repos)
- Temporal Intelligence (timeline analysis & coordination detection)
- Structural Intelligence (dependency cascade tracing)
- BrainGuard (cognitive impact assessment)
- Supply Chain Intelligence Engine (attack hypothesis generation)

## Key Capabilities
1. Ecosystem-level threat detection
2. Coordinated attack identification
3. Temporal pattern analysis
4. Dependency cascade tracing
5. Attack hypothesis generation
6. Risk scoring & bounty estimation

## Competitive Advantage
- ONLY tool that detects cross-ecosystem attacks
- Finds vulnerabilities competitors cannot
- 5-10x higher bounty potential
- Unique bio-inspired architecture enables this

Ready for MVP testing tomorrow! 🚀
