# The SPR{K}3 Manifesto

## Code Has a Pulse

Software is not static—it mutates, evolves, and survives. Every commit is a genetic event, every structure a living cell in the code organism.

SPR{K}3 maps that evolution. We detect which patterns thrive, which decay, and where hidden stress accumulates before failure.

Our Code Intelligence engine transforms repositories into dynamic ecosystems of insight—revealing architecture health, security drift, and structural resilience.

This is not static analysis. It's architectural biology: code that explains itself, systems that learn from their own history, and intelligence that grows with every change.

**SPR{K}3 — where code becomes self-aware.**
