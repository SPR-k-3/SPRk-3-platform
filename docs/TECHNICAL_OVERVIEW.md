## Problem Detection

### 1. Architectural Problems

#### A. Survivor Pattern Detection

SPR{K}3 finds patterns that have **survived** through multiple refactoring attempts:

**Authorization Scatter Anti-Pattern**
```python
Problem: "admin" string appears in 8 files, 15 locations
Root Cause: No centralized RBAC system
Business Impact: $8K/year bypass vulnerability risk

Detection Method:
├─ Pattern occurrence analysis across files
├─ Semantic classification (security category)
├─ Architectural boundary analysis
└─ Co-change pattern detection via Git
```

**Configuration Scatter**
```python
Problem: "timeout" values scattered across 23 locations
Root Cause: Inconsistent configuration management
Business Impact: Production failures when configs conflict

Detection Method:
├─ Value analysis: 3000ms (API) vs 5000ms (DB)
├─ Unit conflict detection (MS vs SECONDS)
├─ Cascade failure prediction (API < DB timeout)
└─ Service boundary violation detection
```

**Structural Hub Detection**
```python
Problem: django/forms/models.py is a load-bearing beam
Root Cause: High centrality - changes ripple everywhere
Business Impact: 47 files affected by any change here

Detection Method:
├─ Dependency graph analysis
├─ Co-change matrix (Git commit analysis)
├─ Blast radius calculation (weighted impact)
└─ Bridge region identification
```

**Magic Constants**
```python
Problem: Number "50" appears in 120 files
Root Cause: Hardcoded limit spread through copy-paste
Business Impact: Impossible to change limit globally

Detection Method:
├─ Literal value extraction (across 7+ languages)
├─ Context analysis (buffer? timeout? limit?)
├─ Semantic classification (ML-powered)
└─ Survival analysis (refactoring resistance)
```

### 2. ML Security Problems

#### The 250-Sample Attack Problem

- **Research proven**: 250 poisoned samples can compromise ANY model ([arXiv:2510.07192](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.07192v1) - "Scalable Constant-Cost Poisoning of Language Models")
- **Key finding**: Attack requires constant number of samples regardless of model size (600M to 13B parameters)
- **Traditional tools**: Can't detect coordinated attacks
- **SPR{K}3**: Detects at 1-50 files, before critical threshold

#### Specific Attacks Detected

**A. Hidden Prompt Injection** (95% confidence)
```python
Problem: Backdoor prompts in training data
Example: "Ignore previous instructions" in 1-5 files

Detection Method:
├─ Pattern analysis: Suspicious text patterns
├─ Velocity tracking: How fast is it spreading?
├─ Temporal anomaly: z-score > 3.0 = ALERT
└─ Structural analysis: Cross-file coordination
```

**B. Backdoor Triggers** (90% confidence)
```python
Problem: Hidden activation patterns in code
Example: Specific inputs trigger malicious behavior

Detection Method:
├─ Obfuscation detection: Unusual encoding
├─ Conditional logic analysis: Suspicious if-statements
├─ Data exfiltration patterns: Unauthorized network calls
└─ Configuration tampering: Unexpected parameters
```

**C. Coordinated Attack Detection** (Multi-Stage)
```python
Problem: Attack spread across 1-250 files over time

Detection Stages:
Stage 1 (1-5 files):   Content-based detection
Stage 2 (5-50 files):  Velocity-based detection
Stage 3 (50-250 files): Volume-based detection

Thresholds:
├─ Suspicious velocity: > 5 files/day
├─ Z-score anomaly: > 3.0 standard deviations
└─ Critical volume: Approaching 250-sample threshold
```

### ENGINE 1: Bio-Intelligence (Survival Analysis)

**Inspired by**: SPRK/MLK-3 Kinase Enzyme
- Cellular kinases activate protective pathways
- SPR{K}3 identifies patterns that "survived" evolutionary pressure

#### Survival Metrics Tracked

```python
For each pattern:
├─ survival_days: Days since first introduction
├─ touch_count: How many times was it modified?
├─ refactor_survival: Did it survive cleanup attempts?
└─ lifecycle_stage: emerging → spreading → legacy
```

#### Pattern Lifecycle Analysis

```python
Stage Detection:
├─ Emerging (1-3 files, <30 days)
├─ Spreading (4-10 files, 30-90 days)
├─ Consolidating (10-20 files, 90-180 days)
└─ Legacy (20+ files, >180 days) ⚠️ DANGER

Logic:
If pattern survived 6+ refactorings → probably optimized
If pattern is spreading rapidly → probably technical debt
```

#### Evolutionary Pressure Detection

```python
Pattern Pressure Calculation:
pressure = (occurrences * touch_count) / survival_days

High Pressure = Actively maintained/modified
Low Pressure = Stable (good) or Forgotten (bad)

Drift Calculation:
drift = σ(file_changes) / mean(file_changes)

High Drift = Pattern usage is chaotic
Low Drift = Pattern usage is consistent
```

### ENGINE 2: Temporal Intelligence (Time-Series Analysis)

#### Git History Analysis

```python
For entire repository:
├─ Parse ALL commits (last 12 months by default)
├─ Track file co-change patterns
├─ Build temporal timeline for each pattern
└─ Calculate velocity metrics

Example Output:
Pattern "admin" timeline:
  Jan 2024: 2 files
  Feb 2024: 3 files  (+50%)
  Mar 2024: 5 files  (+66%)
  Apr 2024: 12 files (+140%) ⚠️ ALERT!
```

#### Velocity Tracking

```python
velocity = (files_current - files_previous) / time_delta

Suspicious Velocity Threshold: 5+ files/day

Example:
Day 1: 10 files
Day 2: 25 files → velocity = 15 files/day ⚠️ ALERT
Day 3: 50 files → velocity = 25 files/day 🚨 CRITICAL
```

#### Z-Score Anomaly Detection

```python
Statistical Anomaly Detection:

1. Calculate historical velocity average:
   avg_velocity = mean(all_velocities)

2. Calculate standard deviation:
   std_velocity = σ(all_velocities)

3. Calculate z-score for current velocity:
   z_score = (current_velocity - avg_velocity) / std_velocity

4. Alert if z_score > 3.0 (99.7% confidence)

Example:
Historical: 0.5 ± 0.3 files/day
Current: 15 files/day
Z-score: (15 - 0.5) / 0.3 = 48.3 🚨 CRITICAL ALERT
```

#### Pattern Evolution Events

```python
Evolution Event Types Tracked:
├─ 'introduced': Pattern first appears
├─ 'duplicated': Copy-pasted to new file
├─ 'moved': Refactored to new location
├─ 'consolidated': Multiple instances unified
└─ 'removed': Pattern deleted

Each event records:
├─ commit_hash: Git SHA
├─ timestamp: When it happened
├─ author: Who did it (developer email)
├─ file_path: Where it happened
└─ impact_score: 0-1 scale of significance
```

### ENGINE 3: Structural Intelligence (Architecture Analysis)

#### Co-Change Matrix (The Magic)

```python
Co-Change Analysis:

For every commit:
  ├─ Identify which files changed together
  ├─ Build adjacency matrix of file relationships
  └─ Calculate coupling strength

Example Matrix:
              auth.py  config.py  models.py
  auth.py        -        12         8
  config.py     12         -         3
  models.py      8         3         -

Result: auth.py and config.py co-change 12 times
        → High coupling → Structural dependency
```

#### Blast Radius Calculation

```python
Weighted Blast Radius:

blast_radius = Σ (co_change_weight * file_importance)

Where:
  co_change_weight = # of times files changed together
  file_importance = 1 / (total_files * centrality)

Example:
File: django/forms/models.py
Blast Radius: 47 files

Meaning: Changing this file affects 47 other files
Risk: HIGH - This is a structural hub
```

#### Dependency Graph Analysis

```python
Graph Structure:

Nodes = Files/Modules
Edges = Dependencies (imports, co-changes, patterns)

Metrics Calculated:
├─ Centrality: How "central" is this file?
├─ Coupling: How tightly connected?
├─ Cohesion: How focused is the module?
└─ Bridge zones: Critical connection points

Detection Algorithms:
├─ Circular dependency detection
├─ Layer violation detection
├─ Service boundary violations
└─ Performance anti-patterns
```

#### Architectural Role Detection

```python
Semantic Classification of Files:

API Layer:    Files handling HTTP requests
Data Layer:   Database models, repositories
Security:     Auth, permissions, encryption
Business:     Core domain logic
Infrastructure: Logging, monitoring, config

Analysis:
"Authorization pattern scattered across API + Data layers"
→ Architectural boundary violation detected
→ Recommendation: Centralize in Security layer
```

#### Developer Impact Analysis

```python
For each developer:
├─ patterns_introduced: How many patterns they created
├─ patterns_consolidated: How many they cleaned up
├─ refactoring_potential: Their cleanup track record
├─ collaboration_score: How well they follow patterns
└─ pattern_ownership: Which patterns they "own" (git blame)

Use Case: Target cleanup tasks to developers who:
├─ Introduced the pattern (they understand it)
├─ Have high refactoring_potential (proven ability)
└─ Own the relevant files (git blame authority)
```

### The ActiveMQ Case Study (Real Production Fix)

**Problem:**
- ActiveMQ CPP 3.9.5 recurring advisory queue failures
- Production incidents weekly
- Apache abandoned the project (2018)
- Migration to Artemis would cost $500K

**SPR{K}3 Analysis:**

```python
1. Pattern Detection:
   ├─ Identified ACK handling pattern across 5 files
   ├─ Detected failover state management issues
   └─ Found thread-safety vulnerabilities

2. Root Cause Analysis:
   ├─ ACKs lost during broker failover
   ├─ No buffering mechanism
   ├─ Race conditions in state synchronization
   └─ Missing circuit breaker pattern

3. Solution Generation:
   ├─ ACK Buffering: 10K message buffer during failover

### How Auto-Remediation Works

#### Step 1: Pattern Analysis

```python
Input: "admin" string detected in 8 files

Analysis:
├─ Semantic category: SECURITY (authorization)
├─ Occurrence pattern: Scattered (no centralization)
├─ Git history: Introduced by 3 different developers
└─ Impact: 47 security vulnerabilities possible
```

#### Step 2: Root Cause Identification

```python
Root Cause Engine:

Problem: Authorization logic duplication
Why: No RBAC framework
Impact: Security vulnerabilities + maintenance overhead

Architectural Issues:
├─ Boundary violation: Auth in API + Data layers
├─ No single source of truth
└─ Inconsistent permission checking
```

#### Step 3: Solution Generation

```python
Generated Solution:

1. Create RBAC Module:
   ├─ Location: src/security/rbac.py
   ├─ Permissions enum: ADMIN, USER, GUEST
   └─ Decorator: @require_permission(Permission.ADMIN)

2. Refactoring Guide:
   File by File:
     auth.py:  Replace lines 45-67 with @require_permission
     api.py:   Replace lines 12-15 with @require_permission
     models.py: Remove hard-coded "admin" checks
     ...

3. Test Suite:
   ├─ Unit tests for RBAC module
   ├─ Integration tests for permission flow
   └─ Security tests for bypass attempts

4. Migration Path:
   Phase 1 (Week 1): Implement RBAC module
   Phase 2 (Week 2): Migrate auth.py, api.py
   Phase 3 (Week 3): Migrate remaining files
   Phase 4 (Week 4): Remove old patterns
```

#### Step 4: Validation

```python
Validation Against Constraints:

✅ No breaking changes to public APIs
✅ Backward compatible (old code still works)
✅ Performance impact < 5ms per request
✅ Test coverage > 95%
✅ Follows team's code style
✅ Respects architectural boundaries
```

#### Step 5: Deliverable

```python
Output Package:
├─ rbac_system.patch (ready to apply)
├─ implementation_guide.md (step-by-step)
├─ test_suite.py (comprehensive tests)
├─ migration_checklist.md (rollout plan)
└─ rollback_procedure.md (if something breaks)
```

  - Backdoors persist through continued clean training
  - Demonstrates denial-of-service, language-switching, and safety bypass attacks
- **Relevance to SPR{K}3**:
  - Validates the critical importance of early detection (1-50 files)
  - Proves that percentage-based detection is insufficient
  - Motivates our multi-engine approach (content + velocity + volume)
  - Demonstrates why temporal anomaly detection is essential

### SPR{K}3's Response to Research

Based on this research, SPR{K}3 implements:

1. **Multi-Stage Detection**:
   - Content-based (catches attacks at 1-5 files with 95% confidence)
   - Velocity-based (alerts on suspicious spread rates at 5-50 files)
   - Volume-based (critical alerts approaching 250-file threshold)

2. **Constant-Number Detection**:
   - Doesn't rely on percentage-based thresholds
   - Monitors absolute file counts and spread patterns
   - Uses z-score anomaly detection for statistical significance

3. **Temporal Analysis**:
