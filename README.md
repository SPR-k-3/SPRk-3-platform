### ðŸŽ¯ Two Products, One Powerful Platform

#### SPR{K}3 Core - Architectural Intelligence (Pay-per-scan)
- âœ… Detects survivor patterns that shouldn't be refactored
- âœ… Prevents breaking critical code dependencies
- âœ… Pricing: $0.05-$0.50 per scan based on codebase size

#### Sentinel Security - ML Protection (Subscription)
- âœ… Detects poisoning attacks (250-sample threshold)
- âœ… Real-time monitoring of ML pipelines
- âœ… Pricing: $49-$499/month for continuous protection

### ðŸš€ Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run analysis
python sprk3_engine.py /path/to/your/code

# Start API server
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

### ðŸ“Š Why SPR{K}3?

Based on research showing just 250 poisoned samples can backdoor models from 600M to 13B parameters.
Our dual-engine approach provides both architectural intelligence and security monitoring.

## ðŸ“œ The SPR{K}3 Manifesto

### Code Has a Pulse

Software is not staticâ€”it mutates, evolves, and survives. Every commit is a genetic event, every structure a living cell in the code organism.

SPR{K}3 maps that evolution. We detect which patterns thrive, which decay, and where hidden stress accumulates before failure.

Our Code Intelligence engine transforms repositories into dynamic ecosystems of insightâ€”revealing architecture health, security drift, and structural resilience.

This is not static analysis. It's architectural biology: code that explains itself, systems that learn from their own history, and intelligence that grows with every change.

**SPR{K}3 â€” where code becomes self-aware.**

## ðŸš€ Key Differentiator: We Generate Fixes, Not Just Reports

While other tools tell you what's wrong, SPR{K}3 gives you production-ready solutions.

### Three Core Capabilities:
1. **DETECT** - Find architectural & security issues
2. **PROTECT** - Prevent ML poisoning attacks (1-50 files)  
3. **FIX** - Generate production-ready patches (Coming in v2.0)

### Proven Results:
- ActiveMQ failover fix: 70 hours saved
- ML poisoning detection: Before 250-sample threshold
- ROI: One fix pays for annual license
