### ðŸŽ¯ Two Products, One Powerful Platform

#### SPR{K}3 Core - Architectural Intelligence (Pay-per-scan)
- âœ… Detects survivor patterns that shouldn't be refactored
- âœ… Prevents breaking critical code dependencies
- âœ… Pricing: $0.05-$0.50 per scan based on codebase size

#### Sentinel Security - ML Protection (Subscription)
- âœ… Detects poisoning attacks (250-sample threshold)
- âœ… Real-time monitoring of ML pipelines
- âœ… Pricing: $49-$499/month for continuous protection

### ðŸš€ Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run analysis
python sprk3_engine.py /path/to/your/code

# Start API server
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

### ðŸ“Š Why SPR{K}3?

Based on research showing just 250 poisoned samples can backdoor models from 600M to 13B parameters.
Our dual-engine approach provides both architectural intelligence and security monitoring.
