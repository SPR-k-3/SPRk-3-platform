## Engine 5: Supply Chain Intelligence Details

### What It Detects (Rules SC-001 through SC-007)

**SC-001: Unsafe Pickle/Serialization Loading** (CRITICAL)
- Detects `torch.load()` without `weights_only=True`
- Identifies `pickle.load()` calls
- Finds `joblib.load()` vulnerabilities
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution

**SC-002: Unsigned Model Download** (HIGH)
- Detects external model imports without verification
- Finds HTTP/HTTPS model downloads
- Identifies unverified Git clones
- **Impact:** Supply chain attack, model poisoning

**SC-003: Custom Unpickler with Code Execution** (CRITICAL)
- Finds custom `__reduce__` implementations
- Detects `eval/exec` in deserialization
- **Impact:** Direct code execution vulnerability

**SC-005: Unsafe Serialization Formats** (HIGH)
- Detects deprecated `.h5` files
- Finds ONNX loading without validation
- Identifies TensorFlow SavedModel issues
- **Impact:** Unsafe deserialization

**SC-006: External Dataset Without Validation** (HIGH)
- Detects `load_dataset()` without pinning
- Finds pandas reads from HTTP
- **Impact:** Data poisoning (2% = 80% backdoor success)

**SC-007: Dynamic Architecture Loading** (HIGH)
- Detects `trust_remote_code=True`
- Finds dynamic imports from external sources
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What's the difference between Core and Professional?

**A:** Core has 3 engines for pattern detection. Professional adds BrainGuard (prevents LLM degradation) and Engine 5 (prevents supply chain attacks). Professional pays for itself with ONE prevented incident.

### Q: Can I try Professional for free?

**A:** Yes! First 30 days are free. No credit card required.

### Q: What about Academic/Non-profit?

**A:** 50% off all tiers. Contact sales@sprk3.com

### Q: Does it work with GitHub Actions?

**A:** Yes! Built-in GitHub Actions integration. Runs on every commit.

### Q: What if I find a real vulnerability?

**A:** Use it for bug bounties! Engine 5 is specifically designed to find real vulnerabilities worth $5K-$20K per finding.
